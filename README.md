## Setup

[Download and install the extension](https://github.com/moloch--/burp-multiplayer/releases), connect multiple instances to the same [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com/) instance.

You can use `rethinkdb.sh` to start a locally running instance in a Docker container. You can use `ssh -L <local_port>:localhost:<driver_port> <ip_of_rethinkdb_server>` to access a remote RethinkDB instance using an SSH tunnel.


#### Build From Source

From the root of the project just run `gradle all`, which will build a Jar in `build/libs`. The project is partially developed using NetBean's Swing designer, so to edit certain files you'll need it. WARNING: `master` may not be as stable as tagged releases.
